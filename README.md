Welcome to the *official* home of **Bob’s Uth/Camel**.
Yes… you can visit. Yes… you can look.
But **NO**, you absolutely **do NOT** have permission to take my camel.
Go buy your own camel. you just need just a desert annd a tank , a big tank to store water, that’s it.

This majestic creature exists here for one purpose:
**to be admired by you… and owned by Bob.**
